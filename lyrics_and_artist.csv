Why can't I keep my fingers off it?,beyonce
"Baby, I want you, now-now",beyonce
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?,beyonce
"Baby, I want you, na na",beyonce

If I were a boy,beyonce
Even just for a day,beyonce
I'd roll out of bed in the morning,beyonce
And throw on what I wanted then go,beyonce
Drink beer with the guys,beyonce
And chase after girls,beyonce
I'd kick it with who I wanted,beyonce
And I'd never get confronted for it,beyonce
'Cause they'd stick up for me,beyonce
If I were a boy,beyonce
I think I could understand,beyonce
How it feels to love a girl,beyonce
I swear I'd be a better man,beyonce
I'd listen to her,beyonce
'Cause I know how it hurts,beyonce
When you lose the one you wanted,beyonce
'Cause he's taken you for granted,beyonce
And everything you had got destroyed,beyonce
If I were a boy,beyonce
I would turn off my phone,beyonce
Tell everyone it's broken,beyonce
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone,beyonce
I'd put myself first,beyonce
And make the rules as I go,beyonce
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful,beyonce

I can just hear them now,rihanna
"""How could you let us down?""",rihanna
But they don't know what I found,rihanna
Or see it from this way around,rihanna
Feeling it overtake,rihanna
All that I used to hate,rihanna
Worried 'bout every trait,rihanna
I tried but it's way too late,rihanna
All the signs I don't read,rihanna
Two sides of me can't agree,rihanna
When I breathe in too deep,rihanna
Going with what I always longed for,rihanna
Feel like a brand new person,rihanna
(But you make the same old mistakes),rihanna
"Well, I don’t care I’m in love",rihanna
(Stop before it’s too late),rihanna
Feel like a brand new person,rihanna

(Making the same mistakes),rihanna
And I still don’t know why it’s happening,rihanna
(Stop while it’s not too late),rihanna
And I still don’t know,rihanna
Finally taking flight,rihanna
I know you don't think it's right,rihanna
I know that you think it's fake,rihanna
Maybe fake's what I like,rihanna
Point is I have the right,rihanna
Not thinking in black and white,rihanna
I'm thinking it's worth the fight,rihanna
Soon to be out of sight,rihanna

(But you make the same old mistakes),rihanna
I don’t care I’m in love,rihanna
(Stop before it’s too late),rihanna

So how do I know that it's right?,rihanna
(You don’t have what it takes),rihanna
(Stop before it’s not too late),rihanna
And I know that it's hard to digest,rihanna
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest,rihanna
And I know it seems wrong to accept,rihanna
"But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets",rihanna

A realization is as good as it gets,rihanna
And I know it seems wrong to accept,rihanna
