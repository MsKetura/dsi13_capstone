I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
Hahaha!

We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now… Hold up!

That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking, babe?)

(How it's looking, babe?)
Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash

Hello!
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe ?
Le sexe, je veux dire : l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you

Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

All I'm really asking for is you

Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

From eight until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights, I don’t know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you

And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry

He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)
Headed to the club (I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÉ cups
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye, boy, bye, middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry (You)
Sorry, I ain't sorry (You)
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
(You interrupting my grinding)
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Bye) (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye (Bye), boy, bye (Bye)
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me

What are you doing, my love?
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

How I missed you, my love

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C—Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-dah-de-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com—Com—Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-dah-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo
Halo
Ooh

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo, oh oh
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new

Painting white flags blue
Lord, forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh
May the last one burn into flames

'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof

Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?

And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep

Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

So rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady

Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away

Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I found the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own

Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)

"Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation
Obviously a major malfunction"

Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I’m crashing into you
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out

You can turn my lights out

We don’t have forever

You better kiss me
Before our time has run out
Nobody sees what we see
They’re just hopelessly gazing
Baby, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see

Part 1: Ghost

(The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm
Part 2: Haunted

It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me

On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
Me, me, me

I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And Daddy made a soldier out of me (Ooh)
Daddy made me dance and Daddy held my hand (Ooh)
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And oh, that's when he gave to me

With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Ooh
Yee, woo
Ooh
Yee-haw (Woo)

Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, "Girl, it's your second amendment" (Ooh)
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, "Remember..."

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
That's when Daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot (Yee)
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee-haw)
'Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Woo)

Ooh (Woo)
Ooh (Woo)
Ooh (Yee)

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you" (Ooh)
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you (Ooh)
'Cause when trouble comes in town and men like me come around"

So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving

But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive

Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?

Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?

You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars

Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me

Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, too much to bear
(Superpower)

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
Will you ride around with that H-town?
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want
Yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

Bring the beat in

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call

You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

I wish I could believe you, then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply to the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy, once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
And I tried, and I tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I'll always remember feeling like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than another, more than my own life
But that part of me I gave you, it was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinking, "What's up with B?"
I been crying for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me
How could you lie?

Another world, another life

Pull me into your arms
Say I’m the one you want
If you don’t, you’ll be alone
And like a ghost, I’ll be gone

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh

You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
You got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu (Ooh)

I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party!

Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down, with the radio on and the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

So in love, I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knocking 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party!

Set the scene, 3000 degrees
I ain't worried about them, fuck niggas over there
But they worry about me
I got a homeboy named Butter
And another homeboy there, nigga named Cheese
Fuck with me, baby, I’ll make it milk till it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for real-o, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them they never forgot
And nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't studying the beat
Talking to me? Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on there ain't nothing to see
Pshh, always something to saw
I'm the raw, off the rip, cause of him
All of them, will remem-ber the min-
Nute they fell in love with rap, black like having your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm loving you, yeah

So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knocking 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party!

I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to
You go back to

I, I love you much
It's not enough
I love blowing, you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to black
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I don't have a reason to cry
And I have every reason to smile
I don't have a reason to lie
When you’re already reading my mind
And I don’t have a reason to be, if I can’t be with you
And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can’t sing your song
No, I don’t need hands if I don’t get to keep you warm
And I don’t really need myself, if I don't need you

'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you

And I don’t really need these fingers, if I don’t get to touch your spine
Well, I don’t need these legs, if I ain’t walking by your side
And I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you

'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you

I live so I can die with you

Loving you is really all that's on my mind

I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah

I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
Swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

You'll never need two 'cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

'Cause it's about to go down

I'm a take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe
The love that's in-between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me

All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us Bey
I told you that
Out on the road with my people, just doin' what I gotta do
There’s nothing going that shouldn't be goin' on
You gotta trust me, Ma

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

So controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over, stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I've cried
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Hey!
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

Yeah, -eah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh!

(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Me, myself, and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Oh! I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah! You hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I

I remember being young, tough, brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I’m a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this

Cause I put it down like that, d-down like that
And I’m making all these racks, a-all these racks
And I’m moving round like that, r-round like that
When I do it I don’t look back, d-don’t look back

I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

They love the way I walk
‘Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk ’cause I ain’t pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I’m goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, It's 'bout time I show it

I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

I'm a grown woman, and I know that I got it
I'm a grown woman, ain't got no room in my pockets
I'm a grown woman, look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat
Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl, can get whatever she wants
That girl, she got that tight, that tight
Them boys, will do whatever what she likes

(African Vocals)

I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There for the grace of God go, I

I found Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby, you got to understand

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria

Let the mother-fucking beat build in this bitch
About that

I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

I love you
I love you
I love you

Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before, I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love

I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

Aw baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made...
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)

He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)

But, he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know?

Swag the right, surf the left
Work the middle 'til it hurt a little

(Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, oh)
Before I let, before I let, b-b-before I let go
(Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, oh)
Before I let, before I let, b-b-before I let go

See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, got my fangs and my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking babe

Boy this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
I do this all for you baby just take aim
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
How it's looking, how it's looking babe

Drop the bass mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
'Cus when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know 1+1 equals 2
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through

'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby, make love to me

When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Right now, baby, make love to me
We, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die, but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
I don't know much about fighting, but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist, I realize
I'm laying right next to you

Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Ooh, make love to me

When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me

I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I wanna say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in, somebody's life
The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I’ve done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved
I was here
I did (I did), I've done
I was here
I lived (I lived)
I loved (I loved)
I was here
I did, I've done
I was here

You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh

I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl

(Turn the lights on)

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no

Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up‚ don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh‚ take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin'‚ I'm takin' my own advice

Let Mama let you know (Let you know)
Mama's still tryin'
I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it
I had to say that thing twice (Twice)
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I would fight, so I fight
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah
We're part of something way bigger

(Yeah) Bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
Legacy, oh
You're part of something way bigger

Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise

You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than me
Bigger than the picture they paint us to be, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're part of something way bigger

Understand that truth about that question in your soul (Bigger)
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold (Bigger)
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print (Bigger)
Take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise, the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice

If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah
We're part of something way bigger

Body shining, lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul

And never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time and
You keep me humble out of this hype
'Cause you know there's more to life
And if I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul

Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

Bass (Uh)
Hi-hat (Uh)
808 (Uh)
Jay (UH-huh, ready, uh-Huh)
Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh)
C'mon (C'mon)

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu?

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute

Something told me it was over (Yeah)

Something deep down in my soul said cry girl (cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl walking around whoo ooh

I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Then to see you walk away from me child naw naw whoo ooh

So you see I love you so much that I don't wanna watch you leave me baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't wanna be free now whoo ooh, Woo oh

And your warm embrace yeah

Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me yeah

I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?

You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago

It's like we at two places, but different paces
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts, it feels deserted
Did you forget where your heart lives?

What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?

Take a left to compassion (Lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sun right there
Affection (You're in the wrong direction)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care

What about my body, body?

If the storm comes
If we burn up
If the wells run dry
You're my reason
To believe in
Another life

If it all ends
And it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

If we wake up
Lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
I'll feel lucky
To say that you've been
A friend of mine

Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care?
Well, that's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour, you won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care?
That's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you're just given up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, whoa

Through the lies. No matter what i do, i know that i can
Count on you

Daddy used to take me walkin' down the street
Daddy used to take my hand, say, "Follow me"
Daddy used to lead me back home all the time
I got big enough to run around, Daddy left me outside

He said, "Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back"

Daddy used to tell me, "Look up at the stars
It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it"

"But you just gotta find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on

Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Runnin' 'round wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, have to run my race

This is for them 20-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30-somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

Mom and Dad tried to hide the world
Said the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made 'em want me more
At 14, they asked me what I wanna be
I said, "Baby, 21, so I get me a drink"

I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night

And this is for them chipper somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

Excuse me? Um, I love you
Who starts a conversation like that? Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up or hide you
I'll get you out my mind, hmm, I try to
Why you? In my dreams, I knew
You knew how to be there, you knew how to treat it
You knew how to keep it, I wanna do more than touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you up to
We can leave right now, nigga, you don't need a duffle
La Perla, provocateur of secrets
How is it a secret if I know you're gonna peep it?
I see you peeking, don't wanna hear a peep

Wake up, wake up, wake up

Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

Hey there, boy, I love you

I'm watching all these broads trying so damn hard
But I can't even blame 'em 'cause you're so irresistible
I want to stand and yell, I won't ever dare to tell
I think I heard some wedding bells (keep that to yourself)
Is this real?
Ooh child, I can stop praying now
Past life, let's rewind
To the day when I met you
Throwback
Dear God, how could I forget you?
Your sex

Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)

You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins

Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top

If you're going through it, just know it's called "going THROUGH it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive

I love to love you, baby

I wanna hear you say my name, boy

You’re bad for me
I clearly get it
I don’t see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you’re snatching every bit of strength
That I’m gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it’s a heart breakin' situation I’m up in, but I can’t control

You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I’m alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What’s the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down

Baby
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

It’s just not my body (No)
It’s my mind, you don’t know
How many times I told myself
This can't do (Can't do)
And that I don’t need you (No, I don’t need you, no)
It’s so unfair that I find myself right back in your care
And what’s good is that when you’re not always there
(There, there)
You're no good for my health (My health)
You’re just like poison (Whoa, whoa, whoa)

You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
Baby, kiss me one more time
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)

I missed all the signs, one at a time
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear

To the left
To the left
To the left
To the left
To the left
To the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff yes
If I bought it nigga please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And it's my name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking bout
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know bout me
You must not know bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute baby
You must not know bout me
You must not know bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
And call up on that chick and see if she is home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted


Ayo love you need to calm down over something small
Word, you had to flip, that girl ain't mine
She a custie, word life, she love my (cencored)
I know Kianna told words, she saw us both in the whip
Not mine in the business, ugly self with a flat (cencored)
I know that's your friend, but you first need a man
And regardless to what I do
I'mma stay on my grind, bust my heat and make sure there's food
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now
And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out
Now you tell me who that man that got (cencored) who set foot in this house
Girl you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leaving you mad late
You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book,s wilding, and you trashed the place
This is unjustifiable
I'mma do these dishes and wash my (cencored) cus I ain't gotta lie to you

So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I guess love just wasn't enough for us to survive
I swear, I swear, I swear I tried
You took the life right out of me
I'm so unlucky I can't breathe
You took the life right out of me, me, me, me
I'm longing for your heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I'm a trainwreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you, you, you...

Stop! I ain’t ready yet
Wait! Let me fix my hair, yes, yes
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am
Now pass me my dress, yes

I think I’m ready
Been locked up in the house way too long

Like a perm that's been left too long (It's starts to burn)
The result is it just won't take, ohh (I can see)
Now it's all coming so clear to me now (I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you then I can't do
My stock just went up over two million

So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
(Give it to mama)

Yep! (That's another threat)

I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say "I still love you"

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life

I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't
Maybe you'll settle, well, I won't

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life

I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us

Let's... start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over, I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin' me, baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you
You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you

I said yes to your mama

Certainly you can call me, baby
I love to hear from you
Yes, of course you can come and see me, boy
I want to get to know you more
I'm feelin' you
No, baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset?
Boy, you act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful, mmm, mmmm

You was at my house
I was sittin' on my couch
You was really buggin''
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move too slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It's cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you show me your true face, baby
The first time I said no

I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key

I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me

Going outta my head, I think I'm losing all my mind

I wanna tell you words, words of love...

Took me a while, but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about out my friends mouth
I've been beat down
Til he turned my life around
(turn my life around)

Seems like I always fall short, of being worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shinin on me
(no no no no no)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
Loves me

I used to wake up somedays, and wish I'd stayed asleep
Cuz I went to bed on top of the world
Today the worlds on top of me
Everybody's got opinions (they share)
They ain't been in my position (they don't care)
That it breaks my heart when I hear what they
Have to say about me yeah (what they say)

Seems like I always fall short (fallin short)
Of bein worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still loves me (still loves me)
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me (but I want to be for you)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me

I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong (yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best (trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
Shunned by the world (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed, cuz I ain't good
But he still loves me (I just ain't good enough)

If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without out blame

Feels like we always fall short, of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
Cuz I ain't good enough, but you still love me

I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but (tryin my best)
It ain't good enough (I'm not good enough)
Shunned be the word (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed (I don't succeed-ceed-ceed)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
(child sing with me)
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but it ain't good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the word (Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
Cuz I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (The Lord still loves me)
No I ain't good enough, but He still loves me
(Raise your hands if ya understand)
No I ain't good enough (How he blessed you cuz he blessed you too)
But He still loves me (even though I ain't worthy)
No I ain't good enough (you ain't worthy, He's there for you)
But He still loves me (no matter what I do)
No I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (but the Lord still loves me)

Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I've ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you cause this might be our last night

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?
’Cause I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?

Rollin' high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that’s what's good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talkin' lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did, smacked that trick
Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the number one chick, I don't need no hype
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means I’m ’bout that life

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?
’Cause I been on

I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy's, Boudin in the parking lot
Shout out to Willie D
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, lookin' crazy
Shout out to Pimp C
You know, we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn't **** your girl but your sister was alright, man
Ah-ah in ya homeboy’s Caddy last night, man, hahahahaha
Hol' up, Texas trill
H-Town goin' down, man

Ohh, baby
Ohh, baby

I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you?
Boy, don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you, whoa
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby, I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name (Scream my name)
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

I'd rather be with you, oh, yeah
Boy, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, oh, yeah
Boy, I'd rather be with you

I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way (Make me feel good)
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

I'm in this fight and I'm swinging, and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness, but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can barely stand
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you would stretch your hand looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

So what are you gonna say at my funeral, now that you've killed me? Here lies the body of the love of my life, whose heart I broke without a gun to my head. Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead. Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted. Most bomb p*ssy who, because of me, sleep evaded. Her shroud is loneliness. Her god was listening. Her heaven will be a love without betrayal. Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicks.

I remember when you use to take me on a bike ride everyday on the bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why…
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Daddy, daddy, daddy...

I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyoncé, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why…
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities

Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy

(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy...

I'm the matriarch of your land
When you need to take my hand
Come into my arms, I'll keep you safe from harm
I'll keep your precious heart

Some people try to drag you down
Take it from me, stand and be proud
You're a warrior
You're my warrior

Be who you are

Rise up little man rise up little man

Fight for you and me

Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise

They'll burn you at the stake if you
Don't act like they want you to
But baby be yourself
Do good and help the world



Rise up, rise up little man
Don't be scared I'm holding your hand
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get

Rise up, rise up little woman
Don't be afraid to risk it all
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get, I will

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful

I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (be cold)
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be you
That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
Ooh

Why, why?
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful

I heard
Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry

When you were born, the angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath and the world was right again
Tears were shed, how we had been blessed

And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

Well look at me, you were brought into my life
I kiss those little feet and watch for your perfect smile
And when it comes, the world stops in your eyes
I found love, I found peace of the purest kind

And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

Thank God, I get on my knees and pray
Thank God for giving me a life
You're beautiful, you're beautiful, too beautiful
God made you beautiful

God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo

With the door closed, we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go 'BOOM!'
'Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms and look out of my window
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing, OH!

I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart

I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
My body is magnified
In the sun set me alight
My body and your delight
Burn me up, set me alight

I can't deny, your desire
Feel like I’m on fire
When you touch me
I feel the flame
Licking at my feet
And I kiss you, while the sun kisses me
Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel all my loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Make you feel all my good loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun

My body is glistening
So work with, two hearts beating

Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel all my loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Make you feel all my good loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun

Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Hey yo, B

Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)

It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin


Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that

The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that

I'm so in love

I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
The aching

When we make love I can feel all your spirits
Deep inside of me yea
Baby you're so pure, oh

I'm kissing you forever and ever and ever
I love kissing you, kissing you, kissing you

It's been so many years since we found love
You got something special, baby

Be ourselves together
And I love you

You want all my love and my devotion
You want my loving soul right on the line

One night only
That's all I have to spare
One night only

Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side

In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe

Satellites flashing by

Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no no
Do you think
That I could be the girl of your dreams
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes I'm just out of control

You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me

Do you think
That I could be the one that you seek
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby I don't mind
Do you think
That I can make you real happy baby
Just don't get me wrong
My loving is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on

You need to stop for a minute
(No no)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(No no)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
(Seems)
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(Without it)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Oh

You need to stop for a minute
(Stop for a minute)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Before you get too deep up in it)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
You need to think about it
(Think about it, baby)
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
{Outro: Beyoncé}
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me

A gift from virgo

I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that it's real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now

Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me

Do you remember our first kiss?
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together?
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough

When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never, ever want to say goodbye

One day we'll make love
Finally I'll be yours
Only you, only you, I could love you
But it's too late, I already love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable rights" of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice

Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames
Sing it, y'all

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?

Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine
Revolution televised
Hopin' that you see the signs
Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine
Lemonade all the time, keep that in mind
Formation, formation
Exclamation, formation
Fellow great Americans, hello
This is heritage for my medicine
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights aimin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire marshalls and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Obviously guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!

I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world?

I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

(After she saves the world)
After she saves the world

Never knew how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I wanna treat you right

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you outta know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said to Julie "Baby you're my flame"
He givest fever
When we kisseth
Fever with my flaming youth
Fever, I'm on fire
Fever, yeah I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said "Daddy, oh don't you dare"
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever
When we kiss ya
Fever if you live and learn
Fever until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

You give me fever
Catch the fever
Catch the fever

Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin' no corset
Brother's wanna toss it but they lost cause my game made em forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features
Brother's try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin' at but what you lookin' at
We in a bar , wanna twist me like a bottle cap

I'm tryin' to holler miss to see if you gon' holler back

Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that

But this is Milla, Lieutenant if you're wonderin'

And I'm Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin'

But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumb-l-in
See, I have dreams  and with a man, what will become of them?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, cause he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down

I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial

Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now

Give  the chair cause I don't care I ain't feelin' your style

Yo, I'm tryin' to get with you shorty
(But I'm not feelin' you)
But I'm an officer shorty
(My looks are killin' you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talker or manslaughter I ain't feelin' you brothers)

Eyes like the ocean

Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em' high and daddy long stroke em'

Hair like forever

I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still pack a baretta

You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid

Don't waste ya time he ain't worth doin'
He just a sargeant, passin' out tickets for parking

Chickenheads cluckin'

Pitiful bulls barkin'
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when I'm walkin'
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin'
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind too, I wouldn't bless you
If your first name was Ha-Chu, on Sunday singin' gospel

You ain't a dime just a nickel actin' hostile

Headed for the big top and bouncin' off this side show
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I sometimes wish I could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else
Before I was famous I was the girl on the heel with the guitar
I was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach
And now that I'm famous, it's really really difficult to do very simple things
I think it's the hardest thing to give up
But my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim, never make excuses, never expect anyone else to provide for me things I know I can provide for myself
I have dreams, and I feel like I have a power to actually make those dreams a reality
When you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore, you become the property of the public
There's nothing real about it
Just look at these dazzling women
The finest representatives of our nation
Ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown
You can't put your finger on who I am
I can't put my finger on who I am
I am complicated
I grew up with a lot of conflict, and drama's, and I've been through a lot just like everyone else
My escape was always music and I'm so lucky that that's my job
But if I accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with, it would be worth nothing
You know, you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter
You have to have something that is forever
Something that's invisible
I was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable
And I always felt like it was my job to fix the problem
People pleaser, but I'm no longer afraid of conflict and I don't think conflict is a bad thing
Because I know that when you grow up, when you learn a few things , you're no longer afraid of letting go, you're no longer afraid of the unknown
You're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable
And it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say "I like that person," you know?
If I hadn't gone through, you know, some of the painful experiences in my life, I would not be me
And I feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary
I watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective
We do not value ourselves enough
Especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are
I've always been very very specific and very choosy, very choosy about what I do with my body and who I want to share that with
People feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way
There's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life
I always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it
When, honestly, it's very simple
It's just when, you know, a person that believes in equality for men and women
Men and women balance each other out, and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other
I have a lot of empathy for men, and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created, especially for African-American men
I have the same empathy for women, and the pressures we go through
The woman has to provide so many things for their children
I consider myself a humanist
You know, everybody's not good at everything
You know, it's OK to depend on someone
It's actually what we're supposed to do
We're supposed to depend on each other
And when you find the person that you trust and you love
And you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you
It is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life
Happiness comes from you
No one else can make you happy
You make you happy
And one thing that's for sure:
The love I have for music, for my husband, for my child,
Is something that will last far beyond my life

OMG, you done lost yo' motherfreakin' mind!

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up
Even the numbers
Let me exactly hear
But you you wonder
I know how my mama felt
Getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here
This one is over
Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying

Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
I could've told ya
It's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya
But I'm not a pushover no more

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya
Than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than your woman
I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya
But you picked the colors
At night you'll get over
Yeah, like you will never
I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying

Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
The melody told ya
Exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy
I'm not a pushover

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (You lost it)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get
I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying

Now that it's over
I can move over
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
You just confirmed it
This ain't a warning
Been living a double life
You must have lost yo mind

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
(You crazy!)
You must've just lost yo mind
(You crazy!)
They told me 'bout all the lies
(You lost yo mind!)
I took you back all those times
(Tell ya one more time!)
You must have lost yo mind!
(You lost yo mind!)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine
(It was not mine!)
Many earrings must I find?
(Hey!)
You must've just lost yo mind
You just lost yo mind

He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you?
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
That's when its cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (Wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (No, no)
That your love was never true (No, no)
If you let him take me from you
(How could you let him take your woman?)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (Just let me go)
That your love was never true (Let me go)
If you let him take me from you (Just let me know)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you

Pure players
Pure players

Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian, but under the sheets
It's the player from the point
And your girl from the D

Are you infatuated with me?
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I give you time?
I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Undress me undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin' down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots in stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me "p" pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!

The way I feel
Oh girl I know its bout to be
Me all over you
And damn girl you all over me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family

Si yo fuera un chico
Sólo por una vez
Yo me vestiría como quiero
Con lo que vea primero y me voy
Saldría a buscar
Chicas por montón
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van a acompañarme hasta el fin
Cada noche a mentir

Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó

Si yo fuera un chico
Pero ves no lo soy
Los chicos son de un molde
Y nosotras somos de corazón
Se piensan que son
Los del sexo superior
Pero cuando lo queremos
Nos vence nuestra seducción

Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó

Es muy tarde ya ves para regresar
Perdonarte otra vez ya no lo vas a lograr
El lugar que ocupabas tú, ya no está más

Pero eres un chico
Que le vas a hacer
No puedes comprender
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar
No te importa el dolor
Hasta que pierdes a quien quieres
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó
Pero eres un chico

This is just another day that I would spend waitin' for the right one
Staring at the night, and wishin' I could be the one to feel the warm sun...

You're a dream, but I'm wide awake;
I'm in Heaven, for Heaven's sake...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...

You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

Tell me that you're living in a place where no one else can find you;
Tell me that you're singing out my name, hoping that I'll hear you...

Tell me "no", and I'll fade away
But this is lovin' that I won't waste...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...

You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

"What are the words I'm needin' to hear?"
"How do I know if I'll ever love again?"
Seeing your face makes everything clear... (clear...) clear
And I'll never be the same...

You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

Ven y quédate conmigo
Dame el corazón vida mía estoy muriendo lento en mi prisión
Anda dime lo que sientes quitate el pudor
Y deja de sufrir, escapa con mi amor
Y después te llevare hasta donde quieras sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya se a donde voy

Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana, tu compañera
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor

Yo nací para tus ojos, para nadie más
Siempre voy a estar en tu camino
Alma de mi alma, corazón de tempestad
Dime por donde ir
Y después te llevare hasta donde quiera
Sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga porque ya se a donde voy

Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana, tu compañera
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado

Nuestro amor

I met this girl, named Nicki
I guess you could say, she was the rap queen
I met her in the studio lobby
But her booty look bigger in the magazines
She said, "Bey, would you jump in this song of mine?"
How could I resist?
When I heard little Nicki rhyme

It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do?
To have ya'll hatin on me
When I don't have nothin' to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm layin' down in my bed
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said
When you really don't know me yet
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh
It's really been weighing on me
I'm not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But i'm not gonna lose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh
Leave me alone, leave me alone, just leave me alone, leave me alone ...

Deena (The Dreams)
We didn't make forever
We've each got to go our seperate way
And now we're standing here, helpless
Looking for something to say
We've been together a long time
We never thought it would end
We were always so close to each other;
You were always my friend
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love
Hard to see you cry, my love
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
We didn't want this to happen
But we shouldn't feel sad
We had a good life together
Just remember, remember, all the times we had
You know I'll always love you
You know I'll always care
And no matter I'll far I may go
In my heart you'll always be there
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to see you cry, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
But we've got to grow
We've got to try
Though it's hard so hard
We've got to say goodbye
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(It's so hard, baby it's so hard)
Hard...

If tomorrow all the things were gone
Id worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
Id thank my lucky stars, to be livin' here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

When I'm here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I don't care, I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams

When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Ohh

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be

When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Ohh

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh

If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you, I'm gonna take it in, breathe you in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And if I am dreaming, let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than living life without me and you, you

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream

If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know
I know

When I'm deep Inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
Because you're the one that I depend upon

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

TO MY DEAREST FANS in ANTWERP
I’ve never postponed a show in my life
It was very hard for me
I promise I will make it up very soon
I’m sorry if I disappointed you
Thank you for your concern
I'm feeling much better now
And I'm ready to give you a great show
See you tonight
All my love
Beyonce

Boy, I'm - I'm on your runway
And I don't never wanna come back
Put my name on your T-shirt
 love
Put me on your map
....
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
You have to come home
We've really needed you
You're the king
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isn’t a reality yet. Today, women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change. Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more— commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect.
Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal? These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible
We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities

Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (uhum) como llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención, debes oir

Hoy no se quien soy ni se adonde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misión
De tu prisón por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad, que gran error

Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Yo soy tu gran creación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós

Oye
Lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo asi
Ya me voy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor hoy me ire sin ti
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Mi voz!

Oooh Oooooh
Oooh Oooh
On A star
And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we can spend
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never
And I'm wishin on a star
To follow where you are
And I'm wishing on a dream

The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven
I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown underground?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Believing in the cards you must respect its every vision

Girlfriend, get your mind on line
Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last, but you must feel divine
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
Love!
You feel it and you got to let them know it
Love!
Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older

But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the sky

This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay

Well when you finally rise
Then you'll realize

The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes

Oh You could wish on the stars but they're dead, just a lie

But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón están tus cosas
Esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor…
Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco
Tú eras mi luz, pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Ya no soy nada para ti (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Alguien que no conoces (conoces…)
Lo nuestro se acabó (se acabó…)
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó…)
Nunca lloraré por ti (lloraré por ti)
Porque ya me cansé de ti (ya me cansé de ti)
No eres más imprescindible
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Hum…
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
¿Qué sabes tú de mí? (baby…)
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme
(¿Qué sabes tú de mí?)
No hay más que hablar, terminamos
(No me hagas reír)
Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor…

Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Beyoncé, Beyoncé

Miente, lo ves
Es un juego
(Yo conozco cosas del que tu no quieres ni saber)
Sabe decir lo que
Quieres oír
Un bello embustero
(solo por placer nuestra amistad no vamos a perder)

A mi también
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez mas

No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
Nos va dividir? No!
No nos va a excitar
Vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Confiaba en el
Mas cuando lo que encontré
Besándote el cuello
(pero el no lo podía creer las dos caímos en su red)
Por qué a ti?
Si hay mil por ahí
El es un perro
(las dos sin querer caímos presas en su piel)

A mi también
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez mas

No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
Nos va dividir? No!
No nos va a excitar
Vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Lo creía tan mio
Yo vivía por el
Fuimos un desafío
Que pudo mas que el
Es un hombre muy frío
No es de una mujer
Ya no nos puede engañar
Haremos con su juego, ya basta... de sus mentiras
Dile adiós por las dos

No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
Nos va dividir? No!
No nos va a excitar
Vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Feel like I'm loosing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe you belong to me
Oh oh
I'm going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this
This is my final wish
Hook:
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go Let me do B
Chorus:
You've got me chasing after you like an
Ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)
You've got me chasing after you like an
Ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of luck
(And mt heart just melts)
Verse 2:
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized the flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holdin on
It's good to know what's goin on
Hook:
The next your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet

Bridge ending:

Wore that dress you said I'd never fit

There's a moment where things click. When I was in the studio I was threading the songs together and I...thought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child. In my mind we would perform on Star Search, we would win; we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time. There's no way in the world I would ever imagine losing as a possbility. You know, I was only 9 years old so, at that time, you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose! It was the best message for me. When I put Ed MacMahon introducing us as "the Hip-Hop rapping Girls' TYME" it clicked something in my mind. I feel like something about the aggression of Bow Down and the attitude of Flawless - the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never too smart to lose; it happens, and it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things

I was scrolling through videos about feminism on YouTube and I ran across this video of this incredible Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Everything she said is exactly how I feel
My message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection. I had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion. And at the end of the day when you go through all of these things, is it worth it? I mean, you get this trophy and you're like, 'I basically starved, I have neglected all of the people that I love, I've conformed to what everybody else thinks I should be and I have this trophy. What does that mean?'. The trophy represents all of the sacrafices I made as a kid. All of the time that I lost, being on the road/ in the studios as a child. And, I just wanna throw that shit up
I have a lot of awards and I have a lot of these things that I'm amazing and I'm - I worked my ass of, I worked harder then probably everybody I know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'Mommy'. No, nothing feels like when I look at my husband in the eyes, nothing feels like when I'm respected, when I get on the stage and I see I'm changing people's lives. Those are the things that matter and, at this point in my life, that's what I'm striving for. Growth, love, happiness, fun; enjoying your life, it's short - that's the message

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

It's 6 o'clock
And seconds feel like hours as I sit here
And watch them tick away
And just the thought
Of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day

I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile untill I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait

It's 12 am
The crowd is getting thin but it's okay
'Cause I'm not here for them no, no, no
And I refuse
To move from the spot
Until I feel your heart
Pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!

I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you

I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'Til the sun comes down and rise
And come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your absent in the borders is my life
And it just ain't right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
I'm waiting

I'll be waiting
I can't smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you

I'll be waiting
I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I wait right here for you

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

All in all you've been there for me
You showed me things I would never see
I think I'm ready
By my side you been waitin'
Respectfully and oh so patient
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

Baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time
And baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead remember it's my first time

Arm in arm eye to eye
As the music plays emotions rise
I think I'm ready
In your eyes I see three words
Hold me tight 'cause I'm about to burst
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

(It's my first time
Remember your first time
It's my first time)

It felt like
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I gotta give up to quiet
The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strength to follow it through
I'm ready to change

I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

I'm opening up
Show me a sign I can't believe
These crazy emotions flow through me
I'm gonna explode, oh
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold

I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all, no

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath, you take me away

I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

Michelle,
Is the ULTIMATE example of a truly strong
African American woman.
She is a caring mother, she's a loving wife,
while at the same time, she is the FIRST LADY!!!!
No matter the pressure, and stress of being
under the microscope - she is humble, loving and
sincere.
She builds and nurtures her family, while also
looking out for so many millions in so many ways
Michelle, thank you so much for every single
thing that u do for us - I am PROUD to have
my daughter grow up in a world where she has
people like you, to look upto.
Love
Beyoncé

Ay, Ay, Ay
Nobody likes being played
Oh, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Oh, y Sasha, y Sasha (Hey)

He said, I'm worth it, his one desire
(Yo conozco cosas del que tu no quieres ni saber)
He kissed me, his one and only
(Yes) Beautiful liar
(Solo por placer nuestra amistad no vamos a perder)

A mi también
Why are we the ones who suffer?
No hay que caer
He won't be the one to cry

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Nos va dividir?
(Oh) No nos va a excitar
(Oh) Vamos a sufrir?
(Oh) Por un bello embustero

Confiaba en el
Mas cuando lo que encontré
Besándote el cuello
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
Por que a ti?
Si hay mil por ahí
El es un perro
(You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong?)

A mi también
When the pain and heartbreak's over
No hay que caer
The innocence is gone

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Nos va dividir?
(Oh) No nos va a excitar
(Oh) Vamos a sufrir?
(Oh) Por un bello embustero

Lo creía tan mio
Yo vivía por el
And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
Es un hombre muy frío
No es de una mujer

Ya no nos puede engañar
Haremos con su juego, ya basta...de sus mentiras
Dile adiós.....por las dos

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Nos va dividir?
(Oh) No nos va a excitar
(Oh) Vamos a sufrir?
(Oh) Por un bello embustero

It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me

Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand

That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

I always loved you
Even though you did me wrong
I always stayed by your side
I guess I was your fool
I always cared
There's no one above you
I swear
Cheated on me now she's there

She won't answer your calls
Don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standing with open arms
Sucker for love
Kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you

I'll settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one you run to
You come running to
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Settle for you

I can never leave you
No matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again
I'll still be right here waiting
Nothing has changed
It remains
The same
I can't explain

Sucker for love
Your kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you

Even
When the chips
Are down
I'll still
Settle for you
You'll probably
Hurt me again
I'll still
Settle for you
I know I must be
The world's
Greatest fool
I'll still
Settle for you

I will always
Love you
No matter how
Hard I try
Probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Here waiting
Stuck with you
In love with you
Here for you
Loving you
Settling for you
Baby, yea

I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, "Dreamgirls". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is "Listen"...

You know you really, really, really, really
Want to be with me
So why don't you stop beating around the bush
And come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
If you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
And its not wifey

Hey! You're real social
I don't like the way you're looking
Don't get too close
I'm about to take you down to booking

C'mon and touch me D I know you want to

Look, I only need your prints
Don't really care about your frontal

I don't see me living another day
Without your tender kisses
Why don't we retire to the room
Put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now

You trying to act like I'm not a cop

You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to
If that's your style

Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists

But you don't understand the way that I feel
The pain I could heal

I could lose my job for this
There is no way we could chill

So why you bring me this far
Now let's try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
If you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill
Either you down or you peel
I don't want anything without you in my life
You are my baby
Why don't you forget about your girl
And say you want me as your lady
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now
Give in to everything you're feeling that's surprising
Let's make love now

Nah, I don't think so
Your body is like weed smoke though
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go

It ain't about getting locked
Cause it's your steeze I need
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat

Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you

You can't deny your feelings for us
You know it's true

I gotta go, but really now I'm feeling you
I wanna do it, but I don't
You know, I'd feel your thigh, but I'm so full of decency

Go with your instincts and I'm sure it leads to me
There's only moments to see if it is to be...

Woah-ho ooh

I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And it just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight
I'm just tired and I need a change

Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
And something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied
For a little while
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out (woah oh ho-ooh ooh)

I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beginning
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how I like it (trifling)
That's risen enough
You're time's expired

Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
I gotta move around
If I ain't got a ring by now
That means I'm not tied down
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out

I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

Woah oh
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah oh oh oh oh
Woah-ho oh

I like to feel so high and
You feel good feeling low
I like my colors vivid
And you paint your colors gold
I like to see the world
And you like your weekends home
But I've been staying behind
While you refused to go

Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch tv all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me
And doing the same

Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lose you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
Only to find that
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind
While you refused to go

Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

MUSIC CUE: MINE
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far

Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup
On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine

My aspiration in life would be... to be happy
MUSIC CUE: HAUNTED
(What goes up, ghost around)
It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me
You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You're lucky
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay
MUSIC CUE: NO ANGEL
Ride around
We ride around in that H-town
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First go through my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying
Because
You're

So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this."
No, no, no
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
MUSIC CUE: BLOW

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up
But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine
You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I
I gotta move on
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)

Chorus
 Yo where the brother by my side at?
 Yo you really need to stop that
 Get it right!
 It's not even like that
 Try to get a job before we livin outta box black
Put it on that and here's ya demo you can shop dat

It's funny how things turn around
Last night you tryna get down you act like you down
Any other time it's like you steady hatin on Brown
I'm tryna see my name in lights you tryna short  out the ground

You're the one that's got it twisted cause I'm right by your side
I had a bad day you jumpin' on my back for a ride
What can a man say I'm on the run, just for your auditionin
Callin on you every night it's like you never listenin

You're the one that's switchin up gettin to specifics
When you say that I'm just dreamin I be rollin like a Michelin

Carmen you just trippin cause you know I love you infinite
Just so we could be here look at everything I did for this

So why you actin like that
You don't have to take it anymore fight back
I came to far to turn around and just hike back
Trying to get me sidetracked see me on the corner where the sign of the time
At
Chorus x2

And yo I came from the projects now I want the condos
Trying to be a star and now you messin up my cosmos

But you can't find something if you walkin' wit a blindfold
Carmen I can see right through you with my eyes closed
Grown man to finance
You actin like a nuisance
You're the one that's in the club and tryin to do a new dance

Songs you got me singin like my name was Bobbly Blubland
Don't make me sing 'em cause the game you playin baby two can

You're all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely

I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

All of the times
You used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find

I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and sew myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me

I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) 
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) 
I'm gonna be there

You say that hes wrong you say that he's no good
Leave him alone cuz he's gona hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps always runnin the streets
He's playin the game and he'll never love me
You say that he's fake but why does it feel so real
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy oh he's my man
You say you dont trust him b/c he been locked up
You say that he's trouble cuz he out in the strip club
But you were young once so you should understand
You say that you know, so you been a witness
You say its for sure so he got a mistress
Until you can show me im gon' stand by him
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy oh he's my man

Thank you so much. Hi, baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredible

You be sayin'
No no no no no
When it's really
Yes yes yes yes yes
(x 4)
Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Why don't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you "What's the deal?"
You're holdin' it all inside
If you wanna' be with me
You gotta' keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you
Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care
Bug a boo(talk)
You buggin' what?
You buggin' Who?
You buggin' me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!
Any other day I would call
You would say, baby how's your day?
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah okay
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your'one game
When you can not say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
I don't care if we on the run
Baby, long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away

You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me

What are you doing my love?

Make up your mind right now don't contemplate

If you ain't being honest from the go, Tell me

Been near the hood lately (where you from and where you be)

I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing
I only wanted to see you
Laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain

Honey, I know, I know
I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out
For something new, that means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
HEY!

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

I see music. It's more than just...what I hear. When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion. A memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music. And I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do a visual album; I wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head, cause it's what makes it mine. That vision in my brain is what I want people to experience the first time

I feel like, right now, people experience music differently. I remember seeing Thriller on TV with my family. It was an event; we all sat around the TV and now, looking back, I'm so lucky I was born around that time. I miss that...immersive experience. Now, people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their iPods - they don't really invest in a full album. It's all about the single and the hype, there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans. I felt like 'I don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out. I just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans'. I told my team 'I wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time', everyone thought I was crazy but we're actually doing it. It's happening

I wanted to make this body of work and, I feel like it's something that's lost in Pop music. I wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression. Not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album. It was important that we made this a movie, we made this an experience. I wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me. I would make my best art and just put it out and that's-that's why it's out today

I live my life to the fullest
Party every chance I get
Friday nights, the Spot is the place i hit
Decked out, chestout
Me and my girls roll up at the Spot like we own the world
You should see the eyes on me, dress fittin like a prize on me
High split , fellas get the rise on me
Juss from the looks of it , I must say
Ya bound to get hooked , if you play

Your optomistic for someone goin to jail

Would you stop being so damn stale
I know you gotta girl but damn dont u wanna see new things
Security shouldn't purchase a ring

So why you lookin at me like that
Like what u say is tru?

I kno ya type I see through you

Oh yea? What u see??
Cause I love my girl it ain't about security I give her the world
Shes down for and always has been

And I would be too if I was your girlfriend
But Im not
I even take ya too the Spot, bring sand to the beach, keep u on a leash
I kno how most of these chicks could be
Sceemin and plottin on you like me

Listen, you a little too hot for a guy like me
My girl is mo' like me she juss coo ya kno?
Not a risk taker she just goes w/ the flow

Shes wack! Ya need a little spice in ya life
Live a little you'll see what u want in a wife is in me
I'm tellin you its like gold
Hard to let go, Harder to hold
I'll dance wit ya slowly, too a hip-hop joint
And only stop on a positive, you got the point?

I dont dance, i dont drink i dont like clubs im not impressed
I dont smoke, only scrubs go to different places and fall for pretty faces
To me ya'll are all basic

And ya life is wasted
Thats why u a cop
You never got to taste it if you had one drop
You wouldn't go back
I'll prove it to you
Come out wit me tonight, that'll do it for you!

WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE KILLINGS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
IT IS UP TO US TO TAKE A STAND AND DEMAND THAT THEY “STOP KILLING US.”
WE DON'T NEED SYMPATHY. WE NEED EVERYONE TO RESPECT OUR LIVES.
WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP AS A COMMUNITY AND FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT MURDER OR ANY VIOLENT ACTION BY THOSE WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US SHOULD CONSISTENTLY GO UNPUNISHED.
THESE ROBBERIES OF LIVES MAKE US FEEL HELPLESS AND HOPELESS BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE NEXT GENERATION, FOR THE NEXT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE IN GOOD.
THIS IS A HUMAN FIGHT. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS MARGINALIZED, WHO IS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
THIS IS NOT A PLEA TO ALL POLICE OFFICERS BUT TOWARD ANY HUMAN BEING WHO FAILS TO VALUE LIFE. THE WAR ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ALL MINORITIES NEEDS TO BE OVER.
FEAR IS NOT AN EXCUSE. HATE WILL NOT WIN.
WE ALL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANNEL OUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION INTO ACTION. WE MUST USE OUR VOICES TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN OUR DISTRICTS AND DEMAND SOCIAL AND JUDICIAL CHANGES.
WHILE WE PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF ALTON STERLING AND PHILANDO CASTILE, WE WILL ALSO PRAY FOR AN END TO THIS PLAGUE OF INJUSTICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
CLICK IN TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN YOUR AREA. YOUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD.

Bass
Hi-hat
808
Let's go get 'em

Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

Yes

Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu?

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

What goes around, comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around, comes back around (My, my, my baby!)
I say, what goes around comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around comes back around

There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out

I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out

I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around, comes back around
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)

From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-
O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu


Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls

We have our strength (we have)
Small bosses still in progress (we have)
As we say in BO$$ our great-great-grandchildren are already millionaires
Future numbers one on the Forbes list (one, one)
We're going to darken this list (we're going) I do not know what they will be when formed
Just follow Bonnie and Clyde
Dad and Mom are respected
Be like B and Jay Make it rain in the summer
Stop the world and steal it for you
You can small heirs (can)
With love B

Go out tonight
Feel nice tonight
Stay out all night like it's 1996
Pull out that porsche tonight
Front with your
Buyout the bar tonight you deserve it baby, talk your shit
I know you never lie to me

And you've always been faithful
I know there ain't any other guys like you
That's why I strive I i'll be your happiness
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
I, I need my man
To feel like he's a man
To feel the need to question
Where is or who he's with

He's more than my man
He's my best friend
Don't feel the need to check on him
'Cause we got blind trust
Trust, trust, trust
We got blind trust
Trust, trust, trust
If we got blind trust

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

'Cause everywhere we lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

Halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo

You hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere we lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, we can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can see your halo
I pray it won't fade away

Your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
Your halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo

Everywhere we lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, we can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

We can pose for a photograph, all three of us
Immortalized
You and your perfect girl

Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh
Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And you just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight
I? M just tired and I need a change
Sorry boy, but you got me bored, something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while
I gotta
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh
You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beggining
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how I like it (trifling)
That's reason in up your times expire
Sorry boy, but you got me bored, I gotta move around
If I ain't gotta a ring by now that means I'm not tied down
I gotta
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh
I gotta
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But still I see something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohh

I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby
Drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights, boy I'm drinking
Walking in my l'assemblage
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend, boy I'm drinking
Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up , boy I'm drinking
I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then riding with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby
Drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love (I'm nice right now, hold up)
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight
Catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!" Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!" I'm nice!
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in
We be all night (we be all night) love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing, that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?

And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"
(What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like "Oh"
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall

Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)

Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the..... brain

Baby keep loving me
Just love me
Yeah, just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ah-ha-ha-owww

Mustard on the beat, ho!

I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, “If you dare, come a little closer”

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh

Sex with me, so amazing

Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing

Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I cannot mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I’ma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot

So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’ma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me

I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

Get no piece
Get no peace
Get, get, getting no peace
Can't get no peace
(Get, g-g-get no peace oh)

I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
I finally know what it's like

Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
Baby, come here to me
Come into me
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
You can always come into me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
It's pourin' rain
Come here to me

Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want
So come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push up on it

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I ain't tryna think about it, no
Yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it
I want you to homicide it
Go in slow, but I want you to pipe it
And I think I kinda like ya
Up against the wall, we don't need a title

Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it, man, fuck a title

Boy, I always like to show
Get a little bit, come a little close, now
Take it home on your camera phone
Get a little bad, nigga, watch me blow it down

Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it
Ooh
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it
Ooh

Give me some love, boy, give it to me 'til the morn'

Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it, uh
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now to be close to you

Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Well just let it go

I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close, if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you

Too bad she's just eating off your dreams

Sak pasé!

I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum

When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when

Ooh
Oh

Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now

Ooh
Oh

A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh, come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend

It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-oh
What now?

I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Please tell me)
What now?

There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Somebody tell me)
What now?

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
So what now?
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

I'd rather be smoking weed whenever we breathe
Every time you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me

Don't know why, just know I want to
Don't know why, just know I want you

I'd rather be breaking things, cause we can't see
We're too busy kissing
Just making scenes, here come the police
They know about your history
How you live and love like "fuck rules"?
Don't care why, just know I love you

Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul, 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Whoa
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be, a murderer

A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah

Part I: Love Without Tragedy

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
(Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
Part II: Mother Mary

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

Let's capture the moment

Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

Can't you see?
Ain't it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

I'm plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? (no!)
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motionin' you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm lookin' at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffin' asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause—

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door (Let you enter my door)
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed (Using like I bleed)

It's like I checked into rehab (Oh)
Baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab (Oh)
'Cause baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

Now ladies, gimme that

I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low
Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing

I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole

I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah

I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole

I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless

Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I’m wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won’t get the chance to say goodbye
But it’s too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
You can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no, no
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Te amo, te amo
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I’m moving through the light
Because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away

Eat my words and then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire
Fair maiden Rihannagate
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

If you want my golden flower

Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

911, it's a critical emergency, yeah
Better run-run-run
Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now it's done, done, done
And his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fi-Fo-Fum, like the sky is falling down on me
Numb-numb-numb
He so cold, he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Go on and put him away
He's the only one-one-one I ever let get the best of me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no 'cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
No love, no love, no love allowed

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed

All-black on, blacked-out shades (Shades)
Blacked-out Maybach

Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "give me back my swag!" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, "Louis Mane"?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be

Baby, all I need
Oh, do it on me
Like you aim to please
Show me how much you mean it
By the way you please me, baby

I’mma do it do it do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips ain't make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that

Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’fs your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I’ll stay (Stay, stay, stay, stay)

I've been lookin' for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)

I've got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)

‘Cause your Maybach, ain't got what I got (Get it, get it)
Don't stop, it's a sure shot
And your Ferrari, huh boy, I'm sorry
I ain't even worried, so step inside and ride
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride)

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I'd never know (Ooh)
Shadows chased me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold (Ooh)

And you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust (Ooh-ooh)
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays (Ooh-ooh)

Don't you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna run to, when you get to the edge of the night?
Its time you face the sky, ooh

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help

'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel

I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'

'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it (All of the time)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it (Best of me, I'm losin' it )

Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love

Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

My new nickname is "You Idiot" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid in love

You saw me on a television
Setting fire to all the buildings
Yeah, I guess you saw me stealing
But you've no idea what I've been needing

Not the kind of kid you believe in
You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television

But that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

You saw me on a television
Hanging out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decisions
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning
But you saw me on a television
Yeah, you saw me on a television

But that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

Oh, you know me
I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody fallin' in love
Oh, you know me
Everybody knows that I'm crazy
Sticks and stones, they never break me
And I'm the type that don't give a fuck

And that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
Yeah, this is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
And this is the life I live
You saw the half of it
Only the... half of it
Yeah, whoa

Saw me on a television
Saw me on a television

What am I supposed to do with this heart?
How do I take it off if I love at all?
It's like a work of art
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap)

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken hearted soul
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap, bass slap)

It may be wrong, but it feels right
All my fears are gone tonight
I'm lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)

All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay

Yeah
Lost in paradise

I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (Cry, cry, cry)

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life (You'll never see me cry)
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart

But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
All my life

Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone, oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We done forever

We gone forever
We gone forever

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

Sometimes, I get you
Sometimes, I don't understand
Sometimes, I love you
Sometimes, it's you I can't stand
Sometimes, I wanna hug you
Sometimes, I wanna push you away
Most times, I wanna kiss you
Other times, punch you in the face
'Cause every minute, you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you, take my heart from you
And you come running after me, and baby, I'm back with you, oh

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love

Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

Sometimes, I catch you
Sometimes, you get away
Sometimes, I read you
Other times, I'm like, "Where are you on the page?"
Sometimes, I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated, my heart knows better

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it

Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No

I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
I can't help falling in love
I fiend for love
I want it, I crave it
I just can't get enough

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been let down
But never been tainted
So I'll stay thirsty for more
No, I won't hold back
No drop is wasted
I'll let love run its course

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I’m drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It’s all that I need

I'm so intoxicated
I love the way you taste on my lips, when we kiss
You got me so addicted
So much, I can't resist falling into your arms

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I’m drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up

You have my hands to hold
So how come you won't hold me?
Your words are so damn cold
The winter can't affect me
You're man enough to say
What you think is my business
But, you can't say you love me
Even in between the kisses

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

Your arms around me now
Felt like sunlight in the morning
It always comes around
But, just not when I want it
So all you have to give
Is everything I needed
But, it's so hard to live
Just wonderin' if you're givin'

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

You'd rather make up a lie
Then make up a fight
And then you get so upset when I ask you why, oh
I wonder what makes you feel
A part of you can't be real
You said you'd never hurt me
Then, what do you think you did?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer

Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain

Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die, we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it
I thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinking you were out wit' your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimming, in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Yeah, yeah

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but you said

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

I guess it’s over indefinitely
But you and I know it’s not that easy to let go
Of everything, that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won’t forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow
Wanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh

Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Gonna make me say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride

On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (No)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
Love

Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine

And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough

Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough

There could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
We could all fall down
Before our savior could return
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling, cover me, please

The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forever more
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling cover me, please

I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else, you're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe, you're up
The time is now and now the wait is over

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn

Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?
Don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go

Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (Oh)
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go

Try to hold back my tears

Yeah, whoa

Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where we're going, we don't need no brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Baby, we were killin' 'em
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow

You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
Well, this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me
Drifting, settling
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well, then apparently

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Bye bye, so long

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it, just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy, you got me messed up
If we hooking back up, don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away, yeah, yeah

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Ta-ta, so long

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me, what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

We all, we all, we all, we all, we all

I can pretend that I'm not lonely
But I'll be constantly fooling myself
I can pretend that it don't matter
But I'll be sitting here lying to myself
Some say love ain't worth the buck
But I'll give every dime I have left
To have what I've only been dreaming about

Everybody wants something, gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something, fighting for something
I know what you're fighting for, 'cause we all...

We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it’s cold
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No one wants to be left scared and lonely

We all, we all, we all, we all, we all

I'm able to close my eyes, yet my heart's not so blind
I feel so entitled, love owes me, I want what's mine
And some say love ain't worth the buck
But I'll give my last dime
To have what I've only been dreaming about

Everybody wants something, gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something, fighting for something
I know what you're fighting for, 'cause we all...

Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
But boy, you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby, it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better, babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely
Hey, hey, hey

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have, that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on, looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you

All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without

That's how much I need you

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile?
But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh)

You completely know the power that you have (power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (one makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right

And I hate how much I love you girl (oooh)
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you girl (yeah)
But I just can't let you go (oooh)
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me (hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you

I was picking up your clothes in the closet (closet)
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)
'Till I saw a piece of paper saying Tasha (Tasha)
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin (shockin)
It's on receipts here to tell you went shopping (shoppin)
You bought some Nike shoes, but why you buying stockings?

Boy how could you lie to me? Thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I'mma let it go
I ain't standin' around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'mma leave your heart broken on the floor

You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG

Well, I was home late at night watching TV
Got a call from my girl saying "RiRi
Saw your man in the club I thought he was out of town doing business
Said that he'd be back in three weeks?"
And now I'm mad, sitting in the kitchen getting sad
Looking at your pictures

Boy, How could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology
After 3 years, Ima let it go
Can't standing around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'mma leave your heart broken on the floor

You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG

I did you wrong, girl
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl (I did)
But we been in this relationship too long, girl
For you to be listenin' to your silly home girls
Better go on, girl
Now baby think about it (think about it)
Everything we do they gonna read about it (read about it)
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
Do you want to see your picture in that paper?
You know them haters
You hear that 808, the drum
That's my heart beat, I'm going numb
I said Rihanna, I'm feeling stressed
I'm going under cardiac arrest

You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me

What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? hHw's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you
Still not over you

Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you
Still not over you

Did you know I kept all of your pictures?
Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Oh, I tried to forget you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Haha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Got a wardrobe like she's staring in a movie
And she ain't even famous but she got her own groupies
She got her own groupies
Said she got her own groupies (bad)

One spliff a day keep my mind right
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away

I blow tree everyday in my house, in my car, I love to blaze
Got the best smoke on the west coast, in LA (that's right)
Smoking bomb-bomb going dum-dum
Screaming one love got my L up, bout to roll a blunt
Take a puff-puff of the diesel
Hit the plug up till I run us a kilo
I'm laid back in a Maybach blowing zeroes
Up to the ozone gripping my solo I'm so gone so long

I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami
If you ain't puttin' my nigga then we ain't passin'
Light up my troubles then watch them turn into ashes
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
You know I smoke so I can blow the pain away
And as you know
One spliff a day keep my mind right

Wake up in the morning then I pray to Jah
Please give me mercy fi the ganja
Know they gotta' smell this dime bag on this dimepiece
I might catch a charge if the copper search me
Not one, not two, not three, not four
Who the fuck these narcos at my door
They want war, they want war
I make green my decor
Imma let these motherfuckers know who da boss

I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami
If you ain't puttin' my nigga then we ain't passin'
Light up my troubles then watch them turn into ashes
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away

You know I smoke so I can blow the pain away
And as you know
One spliff a day keep my mind right

Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again, maybe we're finally
On the road that's headed away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But baby, we'll hear it when I'm gone

It's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh

What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again
But then again, maybe we gave our all
A song we'll never forget
Baby let 'em play it, maybe it'll save the world
They gon' miss hearing it when it's gone

But it's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh

What if we left every moment that we could spare?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful
That's why I started singing it
But this song is our song, so it's playing until the end
Even if it's the last song

The last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
Oooh

Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

I wanna play, more than you know
So don’t you leave, and don’t you go
I want it all, until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I wanna love, give him my trust
I wanna live, for both of us
I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

Show me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me
Just like me

Possibility
Got me trippin', thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling or let it go?
I can't wait no more
So now's the time to speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you wanna take a chance on something real

'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best (Never gonna settle)
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked him to? (If I asked him to)
To take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me
Just like me

I can do a lot of shit but I can't make you love yourself
But the way you make love
It feels like you ain't thinking 'bout nothing else but us
But you're holding back
Always so strong and don't complain
Holding back
I've been waiting for this all day
Don't be afraid
To feel it
One more time, just feel it
Fucking cry
How you gonna fucking hide from me?
Where you gonna fucking hide?
Just feel it, feels nice

It's about ya secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?

You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door

Blow your secret open wide

Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die, we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it
I thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinking you were out wit' your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimming, in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Yeah, yeah

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but you said

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

I guess it’s over indefinitely
But you and I know it’s not that easy to let go
Of everything, that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won’t forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow
Wanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh

Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Gonna make me say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(when we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride

Oh, oh, oh

Take away your things and go
Can't take back what you said, oh no
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
So I won't be changing too, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees right now, oh

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

I never should've waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye

Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye

Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
His respectful lips for the last time
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you
'Til the final goodbye

Goodbye

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lotta game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (So good to me)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him everything)

T-H-U-G in ya life, baby
One in a million, that's what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got the tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving
And loving, that's all I'm giving

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him all of me)

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry (All of me)
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-oh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within'

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Baby, here I go again

Boy, I'm still in love with you, no matter what you do
We belong together forever
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Here we lay, face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto "could have been's" that we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away

Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
What we were is like a season, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away

We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
A million miles away

Ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah

When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be when I look into your eyes?
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter, more like butter
Since I met you, boy, my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
(Whoa, yeah!)

My best friends tell me "Rihanna, what's got into you?"
I said "LeAndra, I can't explain these feelings I'm going through"
They tell me "Girl, it's not like you to fall this way"
I try my best to wear a disguise, but it's written on my face

Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one (maybe you're the one)
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy crazy little thing called love)
(Whoa, yeah!)

Girl, it's crazy It's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna
Baby girl, for you missing the song, yeah
So tell the DJ put the pon de replay
If you wanna
Come on my bajun, baby
Let me take to Jamaica
And introduce you to the real thing
For the loving where you are
So baby you're my number 1, not number 2
So if its lovin' that you want
Baby, you should make me your boo

Boy, you got me catching feelings (Boy, you got me)
Got me thinking maybe you're the one (Maybe you're the one)
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum (Beating like a drum)
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love (Crazy, crazy, baby, baby)
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
(Whoa, yeah!)

Don't understand the meaning
This means crazy, baby
I try my best not to show
But you know it's so crazy, baby
Crazy little thing called love
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
(Whoa, yeah!)

I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (Oh, yeah)
'Cause they only wanna know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think it's so sad

Get dem haters out your circle (Haters)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (What you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
They're gonna try to take your life

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled, you better recognize
They're not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me cause I know it's true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you

I rest my hand across your lips
Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I alay what is right
But this love, it won't give up without a fight

I'd write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

Wish I could see the dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me it's better just like this

So this is how the story ends
When love is gone, you can't pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You must've known this day would come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

Oh, oh
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye

Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you

I've been watching you from way 'cross the room
Won't ya come and rock it out with me?
You catchin' eyes like you catchin' ties
Over here's where you wanna be
It's so familiar, like we've met somewhere before
And I'm tired of waitin', baby, while you still obey me

Want me, come and whisper in your ear
All the things you love to hear
I wanna come play nice with you
'Cause if I get you alone, I don't know what I might do
And I think that it's about time we leave
'Cause boy, you're my type
You got me so excited
Baby, let's go dance away

So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you 'gon want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you

I'm walkin' over to you, meet me by the door
I'm the girl in the seven inch heels
I got my keys in my hand
Maybe S's on my arms, so guess you know what it is
So act like you know
'Cause a girl just wanna have fun
Knock it out the park for me
Need ya to hit a home run, boy

Want me, come and whisper in your ear
All the things you love to hear
I wanna come play nice with you
'Cause if I get you alone, I don't know what I might do
And I think that it's about time we leave
'Cause boy, you're my type
You got me so excited
Baby, let's go dance away

So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you 'gon want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you

Let too much to talk about it
Not into me, boy, I doubt it
You are gonna scream and shout it
Make you hot how I move my body
So crazy, so amazing
Catch you up and make you chase it
Let me, let me, baby
Let me do those things for you

So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you 'gon want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy let me, let me
Let me do those things for you

Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie

Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love, but it's really only lusting

So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between 'yes' and 'no'

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause baby, kisses don't lie

Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie

You whispered in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see, I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between 'yes' and 'no'

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause baby, kisses don't lie

Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why

Now to sing her latest recording
It's the beautiful, Miss Rihanna

Now this be the last time you did me wrong
No more layin' up in your arms
No calling, sayin' you want me back
I'm packin' my bags, what you think about that?

Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissin' at the bar
Got me cryin'

Oh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

And you can be mad at me all you want
I ain't comin' in, I'll be waitin' out front
Comin' out the door with your girlfriend
You did me wrong, boy, tell me where our love went

Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissin' at the bar
Got me cryin'

Oh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

Now this is the sound of a broken heart
There's only one reason why we're apart
She never woulda made it to your car
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
We would still have us
I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
But now we're, now we're like whoa

Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love

Hear the music playin'
Let it take you to places far away and relax your senses
Just do what you wanna do

Baby boy, what you done to me?
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you
And not to mention good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No, I won't apologize for feeling like I do
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize
They might see I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
What I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you (I'm a selfish girl)
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
(When it comes to love, I don't share)
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope you're understanding
I'm not playing, boy (I'm not playing, boy)
I'm just saying, boy
They might seem I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

(I'm a selfish girl) I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day (Every day)
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
(Need you in my world, I'm a selfish girl)

Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing (Didn't know what I was missing)
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope your understanding

Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes (Ever will deceive these eyes)
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (Hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (Make it clear)
Incase you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Goodbye
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairytales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (Ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time (It's the last time)
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (Never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

Baby, goodbye
Cause I'm never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye
Ohh

When you're at work, puttin' on your t-shirt
And I love it, absolutely love it

It's the smile of a child
It's your eyes, it's your hair

Took a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, whoa

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It’s the way it’s gotta be

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Yeah, no no
Now I know

Ooh
Ah, ah, a-ah

Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (Oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(There ain't nothing I could do about it) No, no

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted (Haunted), haunted, ooh
Haunted, haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door
Haunted, haunted, ooh

In a perfect world
We would make love over war
With our hands in the air
And no problems and no cares, oh no, oh no
Oh America, all the way down to Africa
We keep singing as the world spins
Round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
And round and round and round

And we'll dance in the rain despite of all the pain
What the world really needs to feel love again
What the world really needs to feel love again
Round and round and round

In a perfect world
There would be no lonely ones
We would keep our hands in the air
With no problems no cares oh no, oh no
From London to Japan
Everyone woman, boy, girl, and man
Come on, come dance with me


Maximum bass!

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
Baby, come here to me
Come into me
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, it's rainin', rainin'
Come into me

Teasin' me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you

Gotta have ya for all the things that you do

Amazing that stays with me all night and day

Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

I'm feeling something that I can't understand
It's like I'm captured by the touch of your hand
It's so vibe, it's your style, it's the way hat you smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Holdin' me close happens so naturally
We connect, this electrical feeling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried

Something 'bout the way that you workin' me
Teasin' me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you

Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

You got me spinning like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flyin', but I ain't off the ground
Fallin' fast, I'm afraid, can't escape, there's no way
Never had a feeling like this before

Something 'bout the way that you workin' me
Teasin' me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you

Cause you're really gettin through to me
Day and night babe, you know I can't fight it
Just one look into my eyes and you know you got me hypnotized

Bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop

You might think it's strange or deranged how I make it bounce
Sugar sweet just like a candy cane melting in your mouth
Cotton covered lemon drops make it hard I'll make it pop
Once I'll show you how you'll never get enough

I pop my bubble, hey, I pop my bubble, hey hey
I pop my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop
I pop my bubble, hey, I pop my bubble, hey hey
I pop my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop
For you I'll make it pop
For you for you
I'll make it pop
For you I'll make it pop

Boy don't be afraid of the way that I captivate
Sticky if you touch it, might get lost and you can't escape
Cherry flavored, yummy yum, boy be nice I'll give you some
Of my tasty cake I know you love so much


Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy

I just met infatuation
It's something in his smile
But my obsession can't stand the thoughts of you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it I got you pushing up on me
On the floor
Under the burning lights
I'm screaming look behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twerk (so get up on it baby)
I'm doin what I do

Got me out here whipping my hair awww
Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now lets make it a sight to see, baby
On the floor
Under the burning lights
I'm screaming look behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
Out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twerk (so get up on it baby)
I'm doin what I do

Got me whipping my hair, awww
We flashing pictures
Kodak moment memory
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world just for you and I
On the floor
Burning lights
Screaming look behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
Out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin it like I'm at work

So get up on it baby

Feel the heat burning like the sun
Feel the beat as we move as one
Don't stop til' the night is done
Hold me close, boy, don't let go
Still, I got to know if this is real or just a dream
Because in the mornin', my true love is what I wanna see

Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now (Feelin' you baby)

It's gettin' hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? (Still, I wonder, wonder should I?)

And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up

And not with me (With me)

And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

You and me, we go back to jump rope in grade school
Memories when you were trying too hard to play cool

You’ve always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
(Can't find your way back home)
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone (You're all alone)
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)
Who ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)

There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do)
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to
Look over your shoulder, boy, and you know who'll be there
You know I'm gonna be right there, right there

When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in
Who ya gonna run to?
And you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothing
Who ya gonna run to?
Who ya gonna run to?

Looking back, it's hard for me to see
Just how I coulda been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well, every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy, I think you need to know

(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been, baby

My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire, you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the tables turned
I must admit, I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance, but now I'm long gone

(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
Coulda been the one, baby
Coulda been the one

You played yourself, boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed, boy
Better go and lie in it
But know that you'll be lying there alone

(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been

Another day another reminder that your not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories
The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart

I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, without you

Another tear, another regret boy, that your so far away
Can it be, that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day?
Remember when we took the sleigh ride, remember singing by the fire?
Theres to much that's in the daylight, I keep reliving you and I

Time to try to build a snowman, the time we try to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart!
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul, but for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, no it just don't feel like Christmas, without you
See I tried but it just ain't right, without you

As I was walkin' down the road to Bethlehem one night
I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl

A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah

As I went down into the town to see what I could see
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah....

So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah

Can’t no bitch with no bills on her list tell me how to run my agenda
Who are these dudes still yelling from their rooms staying home with their moms like a husband, oh
Little bag niggas don’t associate with ‘em
Wanna be a god but still on the true religion
Can’t come, nope
Put my hand up on the boat
You are not from the land I swim from
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Please don’t insult my intelligence
My mindset is greater than your relevance
I, couldn't get a hold of your name there
Can't stay long 'cause the money's on hold and I gotta pick it up like daycare
You know I gotta pick it up I don't play fair

Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location
Who's been giving niggas admiration?
I don't really know
Fraud ass niggas who be like that
Men runnin' up behind another man
Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know
I got blood 

No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense, nonsense
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense

If you're gonna run with the bulls better walk with  I gotta know what to with no lights out
Commas on the way, niggas wanna hang, all I'm gonna say when they try to lay the pipe down, is
Nope, your credit ain't shit
Four/five lots and my new whip still won't fit
Fuck are you to me?
Same hoes mad in the back ain't know who they wanna be
No time for the petty nonsense
Any bitch alive with a conscience knows
I'ma be around for a while now
Can't blame me if your nigga don't be giving you down time like he used to
Lately I been in  no bluetooth
I been in the cut getting C-notes
You be in the cut giving deep throat
Gotta pick it up

Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location
Who's been giving niggas admiration?
I don't really know
Fraud ass niggas who be like that
Men runnin' up behind another man
Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know
I got blood 

No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense, nonsense
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It’s the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I’ve gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
Tú me dejas
Te enfadas y después me vuelves a besar
Y así me haces olvidar (Estoy molesto...)
Y no me acuerdo de por qué
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
Nadie me calma como tú
Y me doy cuenta que mi única verdad
Es que odio amarte tanto

And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh)

Tú sabes el poder que tienes sobre mi
Y nadie más me hace reir
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right

Y es que odio amarte tanto amor
Saber que te necesito
Y es que odio amarte tanto amor
No puedo vivir sin ti
Pero odio quererte así

One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
Pero nadie, nadie más hoy me conoce tanto
Eso es un hechizo que tienes sobre mi

That's how much I love you (Te necesito)
That's how much I need you (Te quiero tanto)
That's how much I love you (Te necesito)
That's how much I need you (Te quiero tanto)
And I hate that I love you so

And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

And I hate that I love you so, so

Ain't no pressure
No way we're gonna live forever
So we just gotta live life better
Life better, no, no, no, no, no-no

I already took out the time
Already make up my mind, already
Already claimed, this is mine
Already say that I'm fine

You make it look easy, and not easy
But believe me, yeah, yeah
You make it look easy, and not easy
But believe me, yeah, yeah

But there ain't no pressure
No way we're gonna live forever
So we just gotta live life better
Life better every day, ay
Ain't no pressure
No way we're gonna live forever
So we just gotta live life better
Life better, no, no, no, no, no-no

No pressure, no pressure, no, no, no, no, no-no
No pressure, no pressure, no, no, no, no, no-no

Wanna woke up at a house, feeling like this
Wanna go out to the town, lookin' like this
They know that I'm out
They tryna figure out how I'm livin' like this

You make it look easy, and not easy
But believe me, yeah, yeah
You make it look easy, and not easy
But believe me, yeah, yeah

But there ain't no pressure
No way we're gonna live forever
So we just gotta live life better
Life better every day, ay
Ain't no pressure
No way we're gonna live forever
So we just gotta live life better
Life better, no, no, no, no, no-no

I stepped in the dance
Looking for you
That's when
I felt you on my shoulder
The red light came on
And I knew it
Time to wine down
And find ourselves a corner
Six pack with braids and green eyes
I told myself
Girl damn he's too fly
His jeans fit just right
With the nice lean
Tell him upclose
Now let's sing the chorus

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to  it slow,  it slow now
If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand on her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe
 here we go now

I cannot front
I've been on you
The way that you move
Makes me light blue
If you keep talking like that in my ear
I'm about to put it on you I swear
 this basement
And go somewhere and kick it
It's getting crowded and it's hot
So tell me are you with it
But there will be no hitting
Wait hold up let me finish
I've got something for you


Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
And I'm going crazy
Now your here
You can show me just how you do
Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
I've been waiting on you
Now you're here
You can show me just how you do
How you do

I want to love you and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
We'll share the same room
For Jah provide the bread

Is this love, is this love, is this love
Love that I'm feeling?
Is this love, love, love
Love that I'm feeling?
I want to know, want to know, want to know now
I got to know, got to know, got to know now

I want to love you

I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads

Throw your hands up high

Wake up everybody, get up out of your seat
No more holdin' back now, are you feelin' this heat?
So tell the DJ turn it up until you're satisfied
And if they try to shut us down it's gonna be a fight

Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up high
Get up, stand up
We'll set it off tonight
Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up high
Get up, stand up
We'll set it off tonight

Wake up all you playas, spend your money tonight

The party can't get started 'til you get on the floor
So check your wiggles at the door, tell me what you waitin' for?

Uh-huh, uh-huh (yeah, Rihanna)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (good girl gone bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Oh oh
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
(This feeling's like so real)
Oh oh

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy ‘cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard

Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see ya it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
Take me on I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels
(head over heels)
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you (yeah, yeah)
That's how much I need you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
我也失望
相處那麼長 相好那麼短
總是在親吻中善忘 討厭那快感
把錯誤都給遺忘
(But I hate it)
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
(But I hate it)
你的指尖擦過臉龐
就忘了爭吵的損傷 就像矛盾
都與我們的未來無關

And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (oh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh)

你明白你擅長 把弄我的遐想
從苦痛變換成狂歡
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (why)
And it just ain't right

And I hate how much I love you girl (oooh)
恨自己一邊愛一邊忍受 (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you girl (yeah)
愛恨都是種挑逗 (oooh)
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (no)
And your kiss won't make me weak
我的思想 都被困在
你能透視的目光
美麗的咒語 已種在我身上
Yeah, ooh
Hate that I love you so

That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you
(I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go)
And I hate that I love you so (Ohhh)
And I hate that I love you so, so

All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said show me something
He said, "If you dare come a little closer"
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

The reason I hold on
Cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love

It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over now

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? (on)

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure, 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na-na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon

Please don't stop the music (Music, music, music, music)
Please don't stop the music (Music, music, music, music)
Please don't stop the music (Music, music, music, music)

It's gettin' late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin' like you do
You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

Baby, are you ready? ’Cause it's getting close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us, no one has to know
This is a private show, oh

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So, shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So, shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond

So, shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Oh-oh, yeah

So, shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(I'm going crazy now..)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

No more gas, in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

Your mind's in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
(Your mind is in) Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnected, no one calls
The phone don't even ring
I gotta get out
Or figure this  out
It's too close for comfort, oh

It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

Your mind's in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
(Your mind is in) Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

Release me from this curse I'm in
I've been trying to remain tame
But I'm struggling
If you can't go, oh, oh
I think I'm gonna oh, oh, oh

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

Your mind's in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
(Your mind is in) Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes"
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

And you can see my heart
Said I’m terrified

And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

Stupid in love
Stupid in love

Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size 10 in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
Stupid in love
Stupid in love

My new nickname is "You Idiot"
That's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one."
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist, on repeatedly trying, to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
No, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid

Ain't scared, I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me fiendin'
You got me fiendin'
Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting, tonight is the night
And it can't be wrong, not if it feels this right
Turn it up
Scream it loud, yeah

Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now


Baby, tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever, baby, I'm yours

Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday

We got right now
So get up right now

With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)

I've got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, boy
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
I despise, yet I adore you

And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

You completely know the power that you have (Power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (Why)
And it just ain't right, oh

And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Ooh, oh, oh
Oh

And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you

為我設想
別叫我歡暢 可惜親吻你
忘掉在溫馨中帶涼
視你如偶像 忘掉這麼想最傷
(But I hate it)
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
(But I hate it)
事實是你一刻技癢
便自動勾起我幻想 消失智商
自問我討厭這份遐想

And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (oh whoa)
But I just can't let you go

我開心因見到
平和地相處的美好
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (why)

And I hate how much I love you girl (oooh)
我未能拋得開痛著醉倒 (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you girl (yeah)
無法遺失的擁抱 (oooh)
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (no)
And your kiss won't make me weak
最恨世上 講相知
得你能透視至此
大概這點心意 像咒語玩意
Yeah, ooh
Hate that I love you so

That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way
Hands way up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over, over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Baby, baby, baby, baby, put the work
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over, over

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? (on)

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it

He been gone since 3:30
Been coming home lately at 3:30
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby, you gon' get it
Now I ain't tripping, I ain't twisted
I ain't demented, well, just a lil' bit
I'm kickin' asses, I'm taking names
I'm on flame, don't come home, babe

I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n

I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n

Have the same thing on, about a week-long
Black shoes, black jeans, white tee on
Caught the last flight home, you're working too long
No rest, no stress, no phone call

You wouldn't believe me if I told you myself
See if believing I can show you myself
But I already remember where I woke up yesterday
15 cigarettes in my ashtray I am using
That's what happens when you

Sleep all day, play all night
That's my life, that's the life
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, that's the life
A-all night, up all night
All night, up all night
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, all day all night

Up till sunshine, watching the sunrise
Pull it in, sending chills up my spine
Can't find no time to rest my tired eyes
Can't see, can't see a straight line

You wouldn't believe me if I told you myself
See if believing I can show you myself
But I already remember where I woke up yesterday
15 cigarettes in my ashtray I am using
That's what happens when you

Sleep all day, play all night
That's my life, that's the life
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, that's the life
A-all night, up all night
All night, up all night
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, all day all night
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh!

Sleep all day, play all night (oh, all night)
That's my life, that's the life (that's my life)
New York days, L.A. nights (oh, oh)
That's my life, that's the life (that's the life)
A-all night, up all night (all night, all night)
All night, up all night (oh)
New York days, L.A. nights (L.A. nights, yeah)
That's my life, all day all night (hey)
A-all night, up all night (oh yeah, all right)
All night, up all night (all night, up all night)

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
And I just wanna scream


What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out

I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
And I just wanna scream


What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out

You should tell me what's bugging you
And I'ma tell ya 'bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And I'ma make it easy

Emotions running wild

Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay but won't tell me
It's about ya secrecy

Blow your secret open wide

Type to get upset—get

Type to get upset—cry—cry
Type to get my—the type to get my
Type to get upset—get

I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (cry, cry, cry)

Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life (you'll never see me cry)
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
All my life
Cry, all my life
Cry, all my life

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?

I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my shirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me before a decision, ask this question first

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing

Take off my cool
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I make
Make me a fool or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, 'round of applause
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers, whether win or lose, is...

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing

Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living, it's not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?

Oh, I didn't mean to fall in deep, but I’ve no regrets
You tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed
I gave you my heart, you took the key
But now I paid my debt, it's time I left

And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I’ve just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down


All it takes is one bold move to change everything
All it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough
I'm ready to live

I don’t need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I’ve just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

You can't take this from me
Can’t you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

I won’t take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seem like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

California dreaming
California dreaming
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

We done forever

Oh oh
'Cause this thing is ready
Oh
'Cause this thing is ready
Oh oh
Yeah, whoa

Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where we're going, we don't need no brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh oh
Because this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Baby, we were killin' 'em
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh oh
Because this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb

You're making stayin' over here impossible

Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So, I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(There ain't nothing I could do about it) No, no

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted (haunted), haunted, ooh
Haunted, haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door
Haunted, haunted, ooh

That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach

Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know

My California king

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart

Uh oh
Uh, uh, I told ya
Uh oh
Uh, uh, I told ya

Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar (rockstar)

I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar (rockstar)

Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (oh yeah yeah yeah)
Oh yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah

They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup! You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion, as in going til they say stop
And my, runway never looked so clear, but the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, I better let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) That Rihanna reign just don't let up
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) That Rihanna reign just don't let up
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) That Rihanna reign just don't let up
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

The flow so tight and the beat so sick
Y'all never thought she now come hard like this
And take no shit, we reads that shit
We did the dirt 'cause she's the princess
She hard, we hard, this beat so beat
Jump Smokers in the world, let them hate so hard
Barbados, back to Chi-town, say yes, Rihanna came to shut it down

Where them girls talking trash?
Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at?
Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at?
Where your lighters at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

In a hopeless place


Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
In a hopeless place
In a hopeless place

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

California dreaming
California dreaming
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
My California king

Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I’m turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure, 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C’mon, c’mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C’mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it


S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I’ve been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it

It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you're pushing all my buttons
Taking me out of my zone, yeah

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease

Got so much flavor with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase you, like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I can be the girl that'll break you down

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me

I wanna see how you move it
Show me, show me how you do it
You really got me on it, I must confess
Baby, there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come and get me outta my dress, oh

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me (The way you stare at me)
Come up to my room you sexy little thing (Sexy little thing)
And let's play a game (yeah), I won't be a tease (no baby)

Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? (on)

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

Really had me going

Rockstar

Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby
Big cities (big cities)
Bright lights (bright lights)

Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar

My California king
My California king
California wishing on these stars

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king

In a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
In a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
In a hopeless place
In a hopeless place

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna be a murderer


Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs

Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

All I've got


Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you

All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, all I've got are these photographs

What now?

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
What now?

I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again

Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music (Please don't stop the music)

It's gettin' late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin' like you do
You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

Baby, are you ready? ’Cause it's getting close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us, no one has to know
This is a private show, oh

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar (rockstar)

With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer


I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Oh, oh, oh-ow
Yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? (on)

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my shirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me before a decision, ask this question first

Who am I living for?

Take off my cool
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I make
Make me a fool or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, 'round of applause
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)

Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living, it's not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah"
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah"
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you're pushing all my buttons
Taking me out of my zone, yeah

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease

You wanna make me chase you, like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I can be the girl that'll break you down

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me

Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know

Ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride

Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)
Pull the trigger
And you can see my heart....
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard

All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that

What now?

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
What now?

I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
So what now?

Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

To be what you is you gotta be what you are

Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar
